                            Commenting on the results, Apollo Group CEO Ashok Shah said: “In 2018 the Group has delivered concrete results against the backdrop of a difficult business environment.  We have achieved a growth in 
                            premiums and in solid investment returns, when many of our peers have shown losses in both operational and investment returns”
                            <br><br>
                            Mr Shah added: “APA Insurance is still the flagship and continues to grow and provides healthy dividends to the group with very strong ratios.
                            The Group will continue to focus on growing APA Life Assurance and expanding the APA Insurance’s general business in Uganda.  This indeed is a testimony of our commitment over the long haul in this market.
                            It is our vision to continue being at the forefront in insurance and investments in Kenya and other chosen markets.  The Board and Management have agreed that the refreshed strategy of Insuring Happiness, 
                            with a greater focus on customer centricity, will position the company for further significant growth.”
